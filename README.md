# Time

This repo is where I have been playing with rust. The application uses a thread to timefor 5 seconds, and in the main thread it checks for a message received on the MPSC channel. If nothing is received an error happens, so the whirligig loop is entered. 

It's nothing special but whirligigs are pretty cool to see on a screen.
